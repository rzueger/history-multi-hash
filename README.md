# history-multi-hash

- allows to have multiple independent routes in URL fragment
- routes are separated by `;`
- each route is prefixed by an id
- so every app in the page is able to maintain its own
  part of the fragment
- caution: this is just a simple proof of concept and
  not production-ready
